Time series forecasting is an increasingly important activity in an ever-more data-driven world, 
as it allows for predicting future events based on historical data and therefore making informed decisions 
in various business areas. Furthermore, it helps to identify trends and patterns in the data, which can be used 
to improve business processes and increase efficiency.
This project was carried out to analyze the trend of electricity consumption and compare different forecasting 
methods using various algorithms such as ARIMA, UCM, and machine learning.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to model and forecast the time series of electricity consumption in Morocco. 
The performance comparison of ARIMA, UCM, and machine learning methods was carried out to identify the model that 
predicted the consumption values every 10 minutes with the highest accuracy (obtaining clean residuals and good linear memory) 
in the period from December 1, 2017, to December 30, 2017, for the city of Tetouan.
